Product Overview
----------------
SecureFX is a flexible, secure file transfer client with a tabbed 
visual interface that’s easy to learn.  SecureFX delivers strong 
security with support for SFTP, FTP over SSL (TLS), and SCP 
protocols as well as FTP.  Advanced features include site synchron-
ization, relentless file transfers, remote editing, and public-key 
and Kerberos v5 (GSSAPI) authentication.  When you connect to a site 
that supports SSH2, SecureFX has everything you need to create a 
fully encrypted SFTP session.

With SecureFX, it’s easier than ever to perform secure file transfers.
Establish a secure connection with a mouse click, or type a server 
name in the Quick Connect dialog, and then drag and drop files to 
start transfers to and from a server and your desktop. On Windows 
platforms, you can even drag and drop files between SecureFX and 
applications like Windows Explorer and WinZip. 

SecureFX works to complete interrupted transfers, with a resume on 
multi-transfer mode and a “Relentless” transfer mode that automatic-
ally reconnects and resumes transfers when connections are broken.  
The SFXCL command-line utility allows you to automate unattended file
transfers (Windows only).

SecureFX also provides synchronization between your local files and 
a remote directory on a remote server.  You can configure SecureFX 
to upload updated files from the local directory to the remote 
directory, download updated files from the remote to the local, or 
mirror whichever site you choose (mirroring includes automatically 
deleting files or folders that are not on the source directory from 
the destination directory, allowing you to exactly match the destin-
ation and source).  You can also configure filters for synchronize 
operations allowing you to control which files and folders are 
affected.  To enable one-click synchronization use the "Quick 
Synchronize" dialog to configure your synchronization settings; then 
press a toolbar button to initiate a synchronize operation using 
those settings.  If you need to keep more than one remote site 
synchronized, the "Synchronize" dialog lets you create, save, and 
manage session synchronizations, and initiate comparison operations.

Quickly find the files you want to work with using the filter view, 
bookmarks, and the address bar.  The tree-based session manager lets 
you arrange hundreds of sites any way you like.  Named sessions 
allow you to save preferences for individual sites.  Named firewalls 
can be used on a session-specific basis so that you can work from 
multiple locations with different firewalls.  SecureFX also provides 
support for IPv6 and the ability to run multiple instances of the 
application.

SecureFX supports AES, AES-CTR, Twofish, Blowfish, 3DES, and RC4 
ciphers.  Authentication methods include password, public-key, and 
X.509 (including self-signed certificate) authentication as well as 
Kerberos v5 authentication via GSSAPI. RSA and DSA key formats are 
supported for host keys and public keys.

If you need both terminal emulation and file transfer, SecureCRT(R) 
and SecureFX are closely integrated, sharing sessions and settings so 
that you can run SFTP, FTP, SCP, and FTP/SSL file transfer sessions 
without reentering passwords.  Or for a complete file transfer 
solution, combine SecureFX with the VShell® server to provide 
fine-tuned file transfer privileges on a user or group basis.

SecureFX includes a 30-day try-before-you-buy evaluation license for
the fully functional application and access to VanDyke Software(R)
technical support.
