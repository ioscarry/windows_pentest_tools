Changes in SecureCRT 7.1 (Official) -- May 2, 2013
--------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - If a connected session was cloned and the terminal protocol of the
    cloned session was changed and then the original session was cloned
    again, SecureCRT crashed.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.1 (Beta 5) -- April 25, 2013
---------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Mac: The permissions on the installer have been modified so that
    users other than the one who installed the application can run it.
  - Mac: Improved the look of the button bar on the Retina display.

Bug fixes:

  - SSH2: If an SFTP connection failed due to an "open channel" error,
    the SFTP tab incorrectly showed the connection status as connected.
  - Windows: If a tabbed session was renamed so that it contained an
    ampersand, two ampersands were displayed in the tab, and the session
    name in the Activator did not contain any ampersands.
  - Mac: If an application had been installed and then uncleanly
    uninstalled, SecureCRT crashed on startup.
  - Mac/Linux: If the session option "Synchronize view to size" was set
    and the SecureCRT window was maximized and the font was small enough
    so that more than the maximum number of columns could fit in the
    terminal window, SecureCRT crashed.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.1 (Beta 4) -- April 11, 2013
---------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Added support for the Cursor Horizontal Absolute (CHA) escape code
    to the VT100 and ANSI emulations.
  - Mac: Improved the look of the toolbar icons on the Retina display.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT could crash if CTRL+TAB was used to cycle through the
    tabbed sessions and then the sessions were closed using CTRL+F4
    without ever releasing the CTRL key. 
  - If the global option "CTRL+TAB switches to most recently used tabbed
    or tiled session" was set, the application window title did not get
    updated when a session tab was closed and a different session become
    the active tab.
  - Windows: SecureCRT crashed after "+++" was typed into a TAPI session.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.1 (Beta 3) -- March 28, 2013
---------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:
 
  - When a dependent firewall session's option "Display logon prompts in
    terminal window" was set, the parent session's username was used
    instead when the dependent firewall session connected. 
  - When a dependent firewall session connected, the dependent session's
    specified authentication method was not used.
  - Windows: If a session was logging to a file and then logging was
    stopped, the log file's parent folder could not be renamed or
    deleted.
  - Windows: If the administrative option to disallow saving passwords
    was set and a password was specified on the command line, it was not
    used.
  - Mac:  The connection status icon and session name overlapped in the
    session tab when there was not enough room to display both.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.1 (Beta 2) -- March 14, 2013
---------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - When the "Scroll to bottom on output" session option is off, the
    session never scrolls to the bottom.  Previously, if less than a
    screen was scrolled back, the session always scrolled to the
    bottom on new output. 
  - Added support for extended packets in Kermit, which allows ASCII
    files to be transferred and improves transfer performance.
  - Line drawing for Korean language fonts was improved.
  - A session using VT220 emulation ignores DEL characters received
    from the remote system.
  - If the global option "CTRL+TAB switches to most recently used tab"
    is set, when a tabbed session is closed, focus goes to the
    previously active tab instead of the most recently opened tab.

Bug fixes:

  - Scripts that attempted to connect an ad hoc session using a
    protocol flag such as "/SSH2" reported the following error: The
    default session is not valid with the "/S" command-line flag.
  - If the font of a connected session was changed, the session's rows
    and columns were not adjusted.
  - When the SecureCRT window regained focus, an extra mouse click was
    required before being able to select text.
  - The authentication prompt was displayed every time a host
    disconnected and reconnected, which resulted in multiple
    authentication prompts being displayed when authentication timed
    out.
  - When SecureCRT was integrated with SecureFX, if a dependent
    session firewall was specified and then the session protocol
    was changed, the firewall field did not get updated on the
    protocol page.
  - Mac: After several days of constant use, especially with a lot of
    switching into and out of full screen mode, the toolbar could
    disappear.
  - Mac: The Connect bar disappeared after going into and out of full
    screen mode.
  - Mac: The minimum tab width global option was not honored.
  - Linux: Loading an incompatible plugin could cause SecureCRT to
    crash.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.1 (Beta 1) -- February 26, 2013
------------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - On Mac and Linux, added the ability to tile sessions within the
    SecureCRT application window.  Sessions can be tiled or cascaded.
    Scripts can use the "Tab" object to work with tiled sessions.
  - Added support for dependent sessions so that a connection can
    be made to a jump host or SSH gateway before the session is
    connected.
  - Added support for the Kermit file transfer protocol.  Binary and
    ASCII transfers are supported. 
  - SSH2 on Windows: Added support for SHA1 in RSA signatures, which
    allows X.509 certificates to be used in FIPS mode and other
    settings where MD5 cannot be used.
  - A button action can be sent to all connected tabbed or tiled
    sessions by pressing SHIFT+<click> on the button.
  - Added a character send delay option to wait for a text prompt.
  - Added a new logging substitution variable "%P", which inserts the
    session's port.
  - Added the ability to copy ANSI text to the clipboard, which allows
    attributes such as color and font to be preserved on the clipboard.
  - Added support for sending Xterminal escape sequences for
    CTRL+<arrow> keys.
  - Added the ability to specify ANSI colors for individual sessions
    in addition to the global option.
  - Windows: Added support for the Wyse label line.
  - Linux: Added support for printing.

Changes:

  - Improved scrolling performance when the session options "Jump
    scroll" and "Minimize drawing" are set.
  - Changed the protocol NO-OP to send decimal code 241 instead of 0.
  - When the escape sequence "CSI ?3l" is received, the data is added
    to the scrollback buffer before the screen is cleared.
  - Mac: The default font is now 11-point Menlo.  This change only
    affects new installations.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT could crash when attempting to clone a session connected
    to a device that does not support multiple connections if prompts
    for both sessions were displayed at the same time.
  - If a tab was manually closed and then was closed by a script,
    SecureCRT crashed.
  - SecureCRT could crash if it was tunneling through a SOCKS proxy on
    a laptop and the laptop was closed.
  - The password prompt was displayed every time a host disconnected,
    due to the session timing out, and reconnected automatically.
  - The cursor went below the session window if the chat window was
    displayed and the number of session rows was larger than the
    session window height.
  - If a machine had two monitors and the main SecureCRT window was
    dragged to the second monitor and maximized, when a session with
    the inital position located on the first monitor was opened and
    switched to fullscreen mode, the main window got moved to the
    first monitor.
  - In the "Connect" dialog, if a new folder was given the same name as
    an existing folder except for different capitalization, after
    exiting and restarting SecureCRT, both folders were gone.
  - If a key was mapped to VT_KEYPAD_ENTER, the key did not work when
    the terminal was in newline substitution mode.
  - SSH2: The global option "Cache session password" was not honored
    for keyboard interactive authentication.
  - SSH2: If a session was configured to use password and X.509
    public-key authentication, if the key was signed, but failed,
    the same key was sent again instead of sending the next key.
  - Windows: If a terminal session channel could not be opened because
    of a resource shortage, an error was displayed and the terminal
    area was not displayed correctly.
  - Windows: The application icon was not removed from the Program
    group during an uninstall.
  - Windows: If "Connect" was selected from the Activator and "Quick
    Connect" was selected from the "Connect" dialog, the connection was
    not made.
  - Mac, Linux: Copying text from an RDP session caused SecureCRT to
    hang.
  - Mac: SHIFT and CONTROL keys did not work with the Chinese input
    methods sougou and QIM.
  - Mac: When Romaji was the selected language Input Source, the
    CONTROL key behaved like the COMMAND key.

    shortcut name contained a ".", the shortcut did not work.
  - Mac: When a Telnet connection failed, a "Broken pipe" error was
    displayed.
