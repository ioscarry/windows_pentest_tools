Changes in SecureFX 7.1 (Official) -- May 2, 2013
-------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - If the global option "Display filenames using Explorer attributes"
    was set and the ESC key was pressed while a file on the local system
    was being renamed, SecureFX crashed.
  - Mac: On 10.7 (Lion), if the "FileTypes.ini" file needed to be
    created (e.g., when SecureFX ran for the first time after a fresh
    install), SecureFX crashed.
  - Mac/Linux: If the toolbar was displayed, when SecureFX was closed
    and restarted, the application window was shorter that the previous
    time SecureFX ran.


Changes in SecureFX 7.1 (Beta 5) -- April 25, 2013
--------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Mac: The permissions on the installer have been modified so that
    users other than the one who installed the application can run it.

Bug fixes:

  - Mac: If an application had been installed and then uncleanly
    uninstalled, SecureCRT crashed on startup.
  - Mac/Linux: If the SecureFX window was repositioned, when it
    restarted, it was not in the correct position.
  - Mac/Linux: The CTRL+F4 accelerator did not close the active tab.
  - Linux: If the Connect dialog was displayed at startup and a session
    was connected, the tab bar did not correctly reflect which tabbed
    session was active.


Changes in SecureFX 7.1 (Beta 4) -- April 11, 2013
--------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Mac: Improved the look of the toolbar icons on the Retina display.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureFX could crash if a transfer was in progress when the
    session's connection was lost (e.g., the remote system went down).
  - The "Upload" menu item in the right-click menu was incorrectly
    disabled if an upload was in progress.
  - Linux: There was a case mismatch between some files referenced by
    the tarball and the actual file names.


Changes in SecureFX 7.1 (Beta 3) -- March 28, 2013
--------------------------------------------------

No changes.


Changes in SecureFX 7.1 (Beta 2) -- March 14, 2013
--------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Mac: Added support for the keyboard shortcut COMMAND+O to open the
    highlighted file or folder.
  - Mac: The Local window and Local Synchronize window get updated
    during download operations.

Bug fixes:

  - Dependent session firewalls only worked when SecureFX was integrated
    with SecureCRT.
  - The authentication prompt was displayed every time a host
    disconnected and reconnected, which resulted in multiple
    authentication prompts being displayed when authentication timed
    out.
  - When SecureFX was integrated with SecureCRT, if a dependent
    session firewall was specified and then the session protocol
    was changed, the firewall field did not get updated on the
    protocol page.
  - Mac/Linux: The Connect and Synchronize toolbar buttons had the same
    icon.
  - Linux: Loading an incompatible plugin could cause SecureFX to
    crash.


Changes in SecureFX 7.1 (Beta 1) -- February 26, 2013
-----------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - SecureFX is now available for Mac OS X and Ubuntu and Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux.  The Mac and Linux version provides functionality
    comparable to the Windows version, including multiple protocols such
    as SFTP, SCP, FTP over SSL, and FTP, as well as advanced features
    like site synchronization and the ability to recover interrupted
    transfers easily.  Integration with SecureCRT is also supported.
  - Added support for dependent sessions so that a connection can
    be made to a jump host or SSH gateway before the session is
    connected.
  - SSH2 on Windows: Added support for SHA1 in RSA signatures, which
    allows X.509 certificates to be used in FIPS mode and other
    settings where MD5 cannot be used.

Changes:

  - The limit on parallel transfers has been adjusted so that it's
    possible to have more than eight.

Bug fixes:

  - If a time change occurred (e.g., daylight savings time) while a
    synchronize operation was active, the file status information was
    incorrect.
  - On a remote system that hides file extensions, if a file was renamed,
    the file extension was removed.
  - The log file did not report the correct directory when an open
    directory failed.
  - UTF-8 encoded characters were not displayed properly in the
    SecureFX log.
  - SecureFX displayed garbage characters for the session name in the
    log when the recently used session list was used to connect to the
    session. 
  - In the "Connect" dialog, if a new folder was given the same name as
    an existing folder except for different capitalization, after
    exiting and restarting SecureFX, both folders were gone.
  - It was possible to add a blank file type.
  - SCP: If a directory had more than nine links, it was not displayed in
    the file list.
  - Windows: SecureFX did not honor the "Display filenames using Explorer
    attributes" global option.
  - Windows: The application icon was not removed from the Program
    group during an uninstall.
